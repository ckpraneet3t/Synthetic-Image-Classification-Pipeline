# Synthetic-Image-Classification-Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for image classification, addressing the challenge of data scarcity by leveraging generative AI. It utilizes a combination of Google's Gemini API for diverse prompt generation and Stable Diffusion for synthetic image creation to build a custom dataset. This synthetic data is then used to train a YOLOv8 model for classifying images into predefined categories.

# Key Features:

Synthetic Data Generation: Automatically generates a custom dataset of images using Stable Diffusion, guided by diverse prompts obtained from the Gemini API.
YOLOv8 Training: Trains a YOLOv8 model on the generated synthetic data for image classification.
Dataset Preparation: Includes scripts for splitting the dataset and generating YOLOv8-compatible labels.
Model Inference: Provides code for loading the trained model and performing inference on new images.
# Technologies Used:

Python
Google Colab
Google Gemini API
Stable Diffusion (via diffusers library)
YOLOv8 (via ultralytics library)
PyTorch
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Project Structure:
